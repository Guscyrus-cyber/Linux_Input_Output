# Linux_Input_Output

This repository demonstrates fundamental input/output operations in Linux using terminal commands and scripting. It includes examples of redirecting standard input/output (stdin, stdout), managing standard error (stderr), and handling data streams through piping and redirection. Users can explore practical scenarios, such as saving command outputs to files, reading inputs interactively, and processing data through chained commands. These concepts are essential for effective shell scripting, system administration, and automation in Linux environments.
